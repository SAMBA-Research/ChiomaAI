ABSTRACT
The aim of the study was to appraise the techniques for adult
education evaluation in Nkanu West Local Government Area
of Enugu State. In order to achieve the purpose of this study,
the researcher formulated four research questions to guide
the investigation. Questionnaire was the main instrument
used for data collection. The data from the structured
. questionnaire were arranged in tables and were worked out
through the use of tables, frequencies and percentages. The
hypotheses were tested using the Chi-square formula. The
study found that effective evaluation is a_ significant
contributor to quality but does not necessarily guarantee
that those in authority will heed the outcomes of evaluation
and take necessary corrective action, and this is the major
problem with the techniques for adult education evaluation
in Nkanu West Local Government Area of Enugu State. It is
therefore recommended that programmes should _ be
strengthened substantially through effective evaluation and
the basis for choices about the future should be soundly
established by a combination of internal self-assessment and
unbiased, informed peer review. Also, the vision of evaluation
for the twenty-first century should be one which is made
honest, accurate, and useful by engaging in a partnership
with practitioners, people, and programmes.

CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION

Background of the Study
.        Adult education is the process whereby adults engage in
systematic and sustained learning activities in order to gain
new forms of knowledge, skills, attitudes or values (Merriam,
Sharau and Brockett, 2007). Adult education is also a
process whereby persons who no longer attend school on a
regular and full-time basis undertake sequential and
organized activities with conscious intention of bringing
about changes in information, knowledge, understanding,
skill, appreciation and attitudes for the purpose of identifying
and solving personal and community  problems.  More
expressively, adult education can be seen as a process
whereby persons who no longer attend school on a regular of
full-time basis can pursue organized studies or to develop
their knowledge and skills and so become equipped to
perform roles in their societies in more or less creative or
critical fashion so that they can be of greater use to
themselves, their families and to the community. Adult
.                       1

--- Page 11 ---
education is an aspect of education which can be useful in
achieving the above statement. Therefore, adult education is
one of the principal professions that can take adequate care
of socio-economic, cultural political and environmental
problems of the adults.
The success of adult education in terms of achieving its
goals as stated in the National Policy on Education (2004)
cannot be over-emphasized as it changes the social and   |
psychological minds of adults more than any other
profession, instills lost hope in them and liberates them from
their prejudice of seeing themselves as not capable of
learning. Adult education awakens adult learners to become
aware of their environmental (social, economic, cultural and
political) and psychological potentials and hidden abilities. It
also exerts enormous influence on the larger society in terms
of national development. Adult education continues from
where the teacher in the formal school system who rigorously
inculcates in the individual the desire for knowledge,
understanding and education stops (Eya, 2006).
2

--- Page 12 ---
Fasokun (2006) observes that “Adult  education  is
concerned not with preparing people for life, but rather with
helping/assisting people (adults) to live more successfully as
useful and acceptable members of  their  societies and
contribute meaningfully to the development of those
societies.” Adult education educates adult learners who are
parents/guardians on the better ways of managing the
available resources to achieve socio-political and economic
success in their life endeavours and also make referrals

| which assist other individual personalities and institutions in
dealing with human problems as well as the society in which
they find themselves.

Adult education stands between the adult learner, the
community and policy makers in human societies so much
than any other professional. The adult educator knows the
problems which inhibit effective adult teaching/learning and
effective administration of adult education industry. Adult
education is the only profession that assists adult learners
effectively in their efforts to learn. Okafor (1991) states that
“Thorough knowledge of the basic principles of teaching and

3

--- Page 13 ---
learning and the skills to  apply those principles in
teaching/learning situation, adequate knowledge of the
_ learner and the factors that determine the quality of the
learner’s response in the educative  process, adequate
knowledge of the value constructs that motivate the learner
and the capacity to assist the learner to acquire essential
attitudes and modify negative ones.”

Unlike every other profession adult education deals with
“adult human materials” and environmental problems which
give the individual a feeling of joy, fascination, pride and
enthusiasm. Unlike other professionals, working with

“adults” establishes enduring and infectious impressions
which engenders in adult learners the practical realization of
theoretical formulations inherent in adult education.
Unfortunately, the adult educator in adult literacy centres
receives meager pay which is not commensurate with
services rendered, works in dilapidated and unstimulating
environment without the necessary  teaching/learning
facilities. The adult educator suffers stress, insults and
violence from this clientele and government in handling adult

4

--- Page 14 ---
education programme. This makes the educator feel
disappointed in the profession (Barikor, 2002).
Nnazor (2005) observes that adult education
programmes continue to operate mainly as disparate,
| piecemeal activities that are not integrated into coherent
purposeful strategy in pursuit of a relatively development
vision. All these in a way consistently truncate adult
education profession. The adult educator feels bad as a
result of genuine commitment to do good by transforming
learners and consciously making the society a better place
for living. The consequence of all these is that adult
education had suffered devaluation which makes people
develop a low sense of esteem especially when compared with
other professions like medicine, law, engineering etc.
Evaluation is a complex process that applies to a variety
of contexts. It can be used to support decision-making, and
at the same time, to test the effectiveness of national and
international programs in different fields, education included
(Mertens, 2014). If we define adult education as any activity
that is concerned with the learning of adults, then the
5

--- Page 15 ---
evaluation of adult education appears in all its intrinsic
complexity. Adult education has a place everywhere: in the
workplace, in the community, on the Internet, in hospitals,
cultural centres, centres for migrants, churches, prisons,
libraries, and universities. The activities related to adult
education include (Nuissl, 2009):
(a) Teaching;                                                    .

' (b) Management;                              |
(c) Counseling and guidance;
(d) Media;
(e) Program planning;
() Support.

The evaluation of adult educators implies the study not

only of the models of evaluation, but, above all, the
contextualization of the process as well, since the field of
application covers a very differentiated  spectrum of

| teaching/learning  activities and related competencies,
depending on the purpose, situation, content, modality, type
of learner, and so on. Notably, an actual adult education
evaluation process engages multifarious objectives, such as

6

--- Page 16 ---
obtaining feedback about the  quality of an educational

_ program, receiving information for planning educational
activities, and  assessing the merits and detriments of
learners and educators.

Evaluation activity in the field of adult education is a
critical structural factor for educational approach
optimization, both at the level of the process and the product
of learning. That means that talking. about the need for an
appropriation level standardization of competence at the
beginning, during and at the end of a training program ina
specific field. The importance of evaluative strategies is
fundamental for obtaining information that reflects the
extent to which an adult, having the quality of being formed
has acquired skills to help him for a social integration and a
professional approach. The study is intended to appraise the
techniques for the evaluation of adult education programme
in Nkanu West Local Government Area of Enugu State.

7

--- Page 17 ---
Statement of Problem
Adult education is seen by many developing countries
as an instrument for the promotion of the people’s status
- politically, economically and socially. It therefore deserves as
much attention as the formal system of education. Adult
education centres in the nation generally, and Enugu state in
particular is faced with major challenges especially funding.
The effective implementation of the adult education
programme depends mainly on the motivation, funding,
supervision, as weil evaluation. Designing an evaluation of
adult education and training programs involves a number of
key steps. Such a structure is important so as not to omit
any vital parts of the process. In addition the timing of
evaluation is very important and this should be decided in
advance of setting up any adult education and training
programs. It  becomes imperative therefore to look  at
evaluation techniques of adult education in Nkanu West
Local Government Area of Enugu State?
8

--- Page 18 ---
Purpose of the Study                          .

The general purpose of this  study is to examine
techniques for evaluation of adult education in Nkanu West
Local Government of Enugu State. The  specific objectives
are:

;     1. To investigate if adult education is properly evaluated in

Nkanu West Local Government Area.              |

2. To know the extent adult education is evaluated in
Nkanu West Local Government Area.

3.To identify the evaluation techniques for adult
education in Nkanu West Local Government Area.

4. To ascertain if the evaluation techniques are effective in
improving adult education in Nkanu West Local
Government Area of Enugu State.

Significance of the Study

The result of this study will be significant in a number
of ways. It will be beneficial to instructors and participants of
adult     education     programmes,     local     government
administrators, governments at the national and state levels,
policy makers and future researchers.

9

--- Page 19 ---
For instructors and participants of adult education
programmes, it will enable them determine the extent to
which adult education is utilized in achieving sustainable
development. It will also enable them contribute to future
directions of adult education for greater effectiveness. It will
also be beneficial to Nkanu West Local Government Area and
other local government areas that run adult education
programmes.

    The findings of the study will enlighten the local
government administrators on the significant position adult
education occupies in the development process. This will
make them give better attention to adult education through
better funding, personnel development and __ better
organization of the programmes.

It will also be beneficial to governments at both the
national and state levels. The findings of the study will be an
eye opener to those in government because it will help

| change their view of adult education as a disorganized
programme. It will give them an insight into the real role
adult education plays in sustainable development.

10

--- Page 20 ---
This will  help them  pay better attention to adult
education and probably give adult education equal status
with other types of education. This they can do through
adequate funding and  management of adult education
programmes and through policy review. It will be significant
to adult education curriculum developers. Knowledge of the
extent of the utilization of adult education in sustainable
development will enable the curriculum developers determine
how far adult education has succeeded in its quest for
development. This will help them review the curriculum in
relevant areas where they are deficient and also design new
| curriculum, as the case may be, to facilitate the use of adult
education in development.
The study will also be significant to policy makers. It
will enable them critically look at the current policy on adult
education and determine the need to make the policy more
relevant and stronger than it is at present. Finally, it will be
useful to the general public because it will help change the
wrong image people have about adult education. They will
11

--- Page 21 ---
know the role of adult education in development and accord
the support needed to make adult education grow.
Finally, future researchers will find this work handy as
it will provide them with valid information on the operation
_ and state of adult in Nigeria generally and Nkanu West Local
Government in particular.                               .
Scope of the Study
The study centres on techniques for adult education
evaluation. The study restricted itself to Nkanu West Local
Government Area of Enugu State. It covered the
characteristics of adult education participants, the
contributions of adult education in achieving sustainable
development, and the challenges that inhibit adult education
| evaluation in Nkanu West Local Government Area and how
these challenges can be ameliorated.
Research Questions
The research questions for this stucly are:
1. Is there proper evaluation of adult education in Nkanu
West Local Government Area?
12

IX. Summary of Literature Review
The Concept of Adult Education

Accounts have it that adult education emerged out of
the need to proffer solutions to myriad of problems caused by
and which in turn affect adults in the society. Such problems
are created by industrial revolution, civil wars and world
wars 1 and 11 as well as the society’s concern for man’s
salvation. Adult education was  identified during these
periods with the task of teaching adults how to read so they

14

--- Page 24 ---
could attain salvation through the Holy Scriptures. At this
point in history, adult education became publicly defined as
a discrete field of social practice which serves primarily as an
instrument of social reform, social reconstruction and social
progress (Anyanwu, 1987).

Anyanwu (1987) pointed out that the  problems
generated by the above mentioned events are concerned with
change, and it is these problems which adult education is
called upon to solve. According to him, its major focus is the
dissemination of knowledge, the training of the mind in
objective reasoning, and the teaching of skills which may
enable the individual to fulfill himself, and to play a fuil role
in the development of the society to which he belongs.
Anyanwu quoted Prosser as seeing adult education as a force
that generates the energy which is necessary for change.

According to him, Prosser defines adult education as:
That force which, in its ideal application, can bring about a
maximum of readjustment of attitude within a sociely to any
new and changed situation in the shortest possible time, and
which helps to initiate change which evolves aud imparts.

15

--- Page 25 ---
new skills and technique required and made necessary by
the change (Anyanwu 1987).

A definition considered more balanced, encompassing,
comprehensive and elaborate was given by UNESCO in its
1976 Conference. UNESCO according to Bown and Tomori

_ (1979) defines adult education as: The entire body of
organized educational process, whatever the content, level
and methods, whether formal or otherwise, whether they
promote or replace initial education in the schools, colleges
or universities as well as in apprenticeship, whereby persons
regarded as an adult by the society to which they belong
develop their abilities, enrich their knowledge, improve their
technical or professional qualifications and bring about
changes in their attitude or behaviour in the two fold
perspective of full personal development and participation in
balanced and independent social, economic and cultural
development.

This definition harmonized the various components of
patches of definitions that were existed before 1976 and
formed the foundation on  which various discrete new

16

--- Page 26 ---
definitions of adult education are being emanated. For
instance, Nzeneri (2008) defines adult education as any
education given to adults based on their social, political,
cultural and economic needs and problems to enable them
adjust fully to changes and challenges in their lives and
society. Eheazu (1998) sees it as “some specific functional
training/vocational programmes required by adults (who now
constitute the illiterate, unskilled, semi-skilled or semi-
| professional labour force) to remedy not only their
educational deficiencies but also meet the needs of their
various occupations whether as farmers, artisans or
employees of corporate/private organizations”. He went
further to refer to it as any form of alternative education that
would re-orientate adults and modify their attitudes in order
that they embrace new and progressive ways and actions
that would improve their income, living standard and
contributions to societal development as well as bring about
in them desired changes in their behaviour.
Organization for   Economic Co-operation and
Development in Nnazor (2005) stresses that adult education
7

--- Page 27 ---
encompasses all education and training activities undertaken

_ by adults for professional or personal reasons. According to
them, it includes general, vocational and enterprise based
training within a lifelong perspective. Barilor (2002) defines
adult education as: Any form of educative experience engaged
in by people who are  chronologically mature, socially
responsible and mentally alert or deficient but eager to meet
their specific needs. These may include intellectual need,
occupational   slalls,    socio-economic   responsibilities,
professional competencies and even self-fulfillment or self-

~ actualizing needs, to improve themselves, by developing their
knowledge, insights, tastes, attitudes and skills.

Adult education according to Mbalisi (2010) is “any
educative and purposeful learning activity organized for
adults to initiate them into a new way of life by provicing
them with relevant skills, competences, knowledge,
information and attitudes required to excel in that aspect of
life’. Sociologically, Dumazedier in Ezimah (2004:12) defines
adult education as: Action for the cultural development of the
society or its  component groups; consciously  directed

18

--- Page 28 ---
towards the development of the economy of society and of the

human personality, by means of a system of continuous or

recurrent learning which brings the culture and cultural

levels which are mostly  capable of encouraging such
| development.                              .

Educating adults differs from educating children in
several ways given that adults have accumulated knowledge
and work experience which can add to the learning
experience. Most adult education is voluntary, therefore, the
participants are generally self-motivated, unless required to
participate, by an employer. The science and art of helping
adults learn, the practice of adult education is referred to as
andragogy, to distinguish it from the traditional school-based
education for children pedagogy. Unlike children, adults are
seen as more self-directed, rather than relying on others for
help.

Adults are mature and therefore have knowledge and
have gained life experiences which provide them a foundation
of learning. An adult's readiness to learn is linked to their
need to have the information. Their orientation to learn is

19

--- Page 29 ---
problem centered rather than  subject centered. Their
motivation to learn is internal.

Adults frequently apply their knowledge in a practical
fashion to learn effectively. They must have a reasonable
expectation that the knowledge they gain will help them
further their goals. For example, during the 1990s, many

- adults, including mostly office workers, enrolled in computer
training courses. These courses would teach basic use of the
operating system or specific application software. Because
the abstractions governing the user's interactions with a PC
were so new, many people who had been working white-collar
jobs for ten years or more eventually took such training
courses, either at their own whim (to gain computer skills
and thus earn higher pay) or at the behest of their managers.

The principles of andragogy flow directly from an
understanding of the characteristics of adults as learners
and can be recognized when we understand the
characteristics of adults, and sce the way those
characteristics influence how adults learn best. Teachers
who follow the principles of andragogy when choosing

20

--- Page 30 ---
materials for  training and when designing  programme
delivery, find out that their learners progress more quickly,
and are more successful in  reaching their goals. The
Canadian Literacy and Learning Network outlines the seven
key principles of adult learning. In other words, these seven
principles distinguish adult learners from children and
youth.                                          i

2. Adults will only learn what they feel they need to learn.
In other words, they are practical.
3. Adults learn by doing. Active participation is especially
important to adult learners in comparison to children. |
4. Adult learning is problem-based and these problems
must be realistic. Adult learners like finding solutions to
problems.
5 Adult learning is affected by the experience each adult
brings.
21

--- Page 31 ---
6. Adults learn best informally. Adults learn what they feel
they need to know whereas children learn from a

      curriculum.

7. Children want guidance. Adults want information that
will help them improve their situation or that of their
children.

Challenges and Motivating Factors for Adult Education -

Adults have many responsibilities that they must
balance against the demands of learning. Because of these
responsibilities, adults have barriers and challenges against

- participating in learning and continuing their education. The
barriers can be classified into three groups including
institutional, situational and dispositional.

Some of these barriers include the lack of time
balancing career and family demands, finauces and
transportation. As well, things such as confidence, interest,
lack of information about opportunities to learn, scheduling
problems, entrance requirements and problems with child
care can be barriers in learning. Distance and/or online

22

--- Page 32 ---
learning can address some problems with adult education
that cause these barriers.

Understanding what motivates adult learners and what
their barriers are, can assist in enrolling more adult learners.

_ When adult learners  clearly know the benefits of their
continuing education, such as getting promotions or better
job performance, they are more likely to be motivated to
attend. When teachers are aware of the student's
characteristics, they can develop lessons that address both
the strengths and the needs of each student. Adults that are
motivated have confidence and positive self-esteem are more
likely to develop into lifelong learners.

Adult education can have many benefits ranging from
better health and personal well-being to greater social
inclusion. It can also support the function of democratic
systems and provide greater opportunities for finding new or
better employment. Adult education has been shown to have
a positive impact on the economy.

                  23

--- Page 33 ---
Adult education provides  Opportunities for personal
growth, goal fulfillment and socialization. Chris McAllister's
research of semi-structured interviews with older adult
learners shows a motivation to communicate with people and
to get out of the house to keep mentally active. Researchers
have documented the social aspects of older adult education.
Friendship was described as important aspects of adult
learning and the classroom was seen as an important part of
their social network. The development of social networks and
support was found to be a key motivation of adult learners.
As editor of a book entitled Adult Education and Health,
Leona English claims that including health education as part
of adult education makes for a healthter community.

When surveying adult education programs in Japan,
Nojima (2010) found that classes focusing on hobbies and
very specific  recreational activities were by far the most
popular. The  author noted that more time,  money  and
resources needed to be in place so participants would be able
to take advantage of these types of activities. Withnall (2006)
explored the influences on later life learning in various parts

24

--- Page 34 ---
in the U.K. Results were similar in that later in life education
afforded these older adults opportunities to socialize. Some
experts claim that adult education has a long-term impact on
the economy and that there is a correlation  between
innovation and learning at the workplace.
The Characteristics of Adult Education Participants
Learning is a lifelong project — it does not end with
graduation from high school or college or, in fact, from any
formal educational programme. Learning in adulthoodcl has no
boundaries. We learn at work, both informally and-in more
structured ways. We learn in our families, especially when we
assume new roles, like partner or spouse, parent, or
caregiver of our own parents. We learn in our personal lives,
through particular life experiences and _ through  the
development process that shapes adult life; and we learn
{from the world around us, through the media, through
popular culture, through our faith communities, through
hobbies and other activities, and through our friends. As
adult, we are learning all the time and in all our life
situations. It is this learning that is the focus of aclult
25

--- Page 35 ---
education, (College of Education and Human Development,
2008).

Ugwoegbu,  (2003) states that in adult education
programme, there is need to understand the characteristics
of aduit learners involved in the  programme. This is
necessary so that we can be aware of the best way to help
them carry out their learning. In the past, people thought
that it was difficult or impossible for adults to learn new
things. But researchers on adults have proved that adults
can learn as much as the child given a_ conducive
atmosphere. Bown and Tomori, (1979) in Ugwoegbu, (2003)
observed that when a suitable condition for learning is
created, older persons can go on learning as long as they are
not senile. The adult learners may even prove better than
children especially at grasping the implications of some
information.                                     |

Ugwoeghu (2003:86), therefore proffered the following
characteristics of adult education participants in a learning
situation:

26

--- Page 36 ---
i.    As an individual grows older, there is diversification
of abilities, skills, attitudes and interests.

i. He is conditioned by his interest, prejudices and
emotions and also by the attitude of those around
him.

iil. He is voluntary learner and based on this, his
attendance to a programme does not depend upon
institutional authority.

iv. Asa result of changes that have taken place in adult,
his roles and experiences, he therefore needs a
different method of teaching in a learning situation.

v. The adult has clearly defined goals and oljectives
before engaging in a learning activity.

vi. The adult is more of a part time learner.

vii. The adult is an independent learner who has a
problem to be  solving.   He is therefore  self-
responsible, sclf-respecting and self-directing.

viii. The adult has many social roles to play.

Nzeneri, (1996) on characteristics of adult education
ai     S     es that the characteristics of adult education
participants states
27

--- Page 37 ---
participant do influence his learning. So me adult learners
assume it is difficult for adult learners to learn. This group of
people opines that “you can't teach old dog new tricks.” But
this saying has no empirical binding or support in learning.
Research findings reveal that given suitable conditions, old
persons can clo as much or even much better than the
young, Nzeneri (1996:36 quoting Abiose Cole, 1979).

It is a common characteristic of adult participants in
Adult Education to witness changes in their lives. These
changes include physiological, psychological and sociological
changes:

Physiological Changes: As adults advance in years and in
their stages of development, they observe some impairment
in sight and hearing or in physical dexterity. It is therefore
important that adult educators should take these physical
problems into consideration; hence they will assist adult
learners in adjusting to these problems in their learning
transactions. There is need for them to write boldly and
clearly on the chalk board, to speak loudly and clearly; to
28

--- Page 38 ---
allow adult learners to sit in front or at the back of the class
to adjust to long and short sightedness as the case may be.
Psychological  Changes: Nzeneri further states  that
psychologically some adult learners  may have painful
memories of the formal school system which they were
denied of and this may in one way or the other affect their
self-concept or self-image. Their experience of adult
education may be a situation where they are considered as
never do-wells or a place of disrespect where the teacher
imposed on them his pre-determined objectives or knowledge
' to be acquired. These psychological changes may affect or
influence their learning as they move to various adult stages.
The adult instructors should try to ensure that adult
participants in ADE are adequately motivated. Furthermore,
the adult instructor’s behavior should be accommodating,
command respect, friendly and active participation of the
participants encouraged through adopting a democratic and
dynamic approaches to teaching and learning situations.
29

--- Page 39 ---
Sociological Changes: Adulthood, to Havighurst (1961) in
Nzeneri, (1996) has its transition and  crises. It has
development periods which can be divided into three phases
- the early adulthood, the middle age and late maturity.
' Havighurst identifies ten social roles of adult hood: worker,
mate, parent, home maker, son or daughter of aging parents,
citizen, friend, organization member, religious affiliate, and
user of leisure time. Each stage of the adulthood has its
requirements for performing each of these social roles. Adult
educator should take into consideration of these social
changes and must try to accord adult learners’ respect
according to the social roles they perform. For example, a
village chief or a traditional hero etc. will not like to attend
any ADE programme or class where he is treated like school
children.

Other characteristics include - illiteracy, poverty,
disadvantaged /undereducated individuals, ignorance, quest
for new skills and knowledge. Nzeneri states that some
characteristics of adult education participants constitute
obstacles towards effective teaching and learning. It is

30

--- Page 40 ---
therefore very important that adult educators should
thoroughly understand these characteristics  and design
strategies to remove or modify them for teaching and learning
effectiveness. Some characteristics which are likely to create
obstacles in their learning include: anxiety, fear, tension,
aging process, poverty and its associated ills, rigidity and
resistance,

Seya, (2005:97) in bringing out   vividly   the
characteristics of adult education participants first of all
defined adult education as any form of learning undertaken
by or provided for mature men and women outside the formal
schooling system. The main targets are specifically defined as
youth (girls and boys) over fifteen years of age, but sometime
younger as well, women and men, generally poor or socially
disadvantaged. As adult education is seen as a transmission

| process of general technical or vocational knowledge as well

as skills, values and attitudes, which takes place out of the

formal education system, with a view to remedying carly

education, inadequacies of mature people or equipping them

with the knowledge and cultural elements required for their
31

--- Page 41 ---
_ Self-fulfillment and active participation in the social economic
and political life of their societies.

Adults who had acquired some level of formal education
participate in adult education programmes. Persons who no
longer attend school on a regular full-time bases, (unless full-
time specially designed for adults) undertake sequential and
organized activities with the conscious intention of bringing
about changes in information, knowledge, skill, appreciation

. and attitudes or for the purpose of identifying and solving
personal or community problems.

Participation in ADE is voluntary. In most programs
education is provided to people, but not everyone takes it up.
As a result, adult education is for those who come forward,
not for the masses. Based on this  perspective, adult
education is voluntary in nature. This is because the adult
realizes his incompetence and therefore goes all out to attend
a programme to correct them. Participation in ADE depends
on individual’s needs,  choice, environment and interest.
Adult Education   participants in Nkanu West   Local
Government Area are mainly illiterate and poor adults of

32

--- Page 42 ---
which majority reside in rural communities. Their major aim

is to be literate; hence  literacy becomes the major
| programme. Nevertheless, they engage in vocational training

where they train on various skills.

Adult Education Evaluation

Evaluation is a complex process that applies to a variety

of contexts. It can be used to support decision-making, and

at the same time, to test the effectiveness of national and

international programs in different fields, education included

(Mertens, 2014). If we define adult education as any activity

that is concerned with the learning of adults, then the

evaluation of adult education appears in all its intrinsic

complexity. Adult education has a place everywhere: in the

workplace, in the community, on the Internet, in hospitals,

cultural centres, centres for migrants, churches, prisons,

libraries, and universities. The activities related to adult

education include (Nuissl, 2009):

{a} Teaching;

(b) Management,

(c) Counseling and guidance,

33

--- Page 43 ---
(d) Media;
(e) Program planning;
(f) Support.
Counseling  and guidance are activities that are
especially concerned with supporting learners in their search
‘for appropriate educational  offers, analyzing individual
learning needs, overcoming learning problems, and
evaluating learning achievements. Media is related to the
necessity of interacting with multimedia materials, making
searches on the Internet, and the use of new commuinication
technologies. As a result, the evaluation of adult educators
implies the study not only of the models of evaluation, but,
above all, the contextualization of the process as well, since
the field of application covers a very differentiated spectrum — -
of teaching/learning activities  and related competencies,
depending on the purpose, situation, content, moclality, type
of learner, and so on. Notably, an actual acult eclucation
evaluation process engages multifarious objectives, such as
obtaining feedback about  the quality of an educational
program,  receiving information  for planning eclucational
34

--- Page 44 ---
activities, and assessing the merits: and detriments of
learners and educators.

Considering the specific experience of the EduEval
project and the dissonant opinions of some partners, it is
worthwhile observing here that not everyone who is engaged
in making evaluations can be defined as being an evaluator,
per se. A supervisor who makes evaluations and takes

decisions is not an evaluator; he/she remains a person
whose job is to oversee everyone else in the work. Evaluating
alternatives against selected criteria is one step of the   .
decision-making process, but a decision-maker cannot be
confused with an evaluator. Accordingly, a social workers’
supervisor can never be deemed to be a sort of aclult
educators’ evaluator, and the idea that supervision can be
considered “as one of the possible forms of qualitative
evaluation in the field of work with adult educators” (Riva
and Ratsika, 2015) does not make sense.              |

Evaluation occupies an increasingly major place in
public and private decision-making processes, serving many
political functions such as analysis of spending, allocation of

35

--- Page 45 ---
funds, and provision of accountability. On the other hand

- evaluation is also increasingly concerned with learning, with
empowering program  participants and enabling social
transformation.

Program evaluation is the use of social research
procedures to systematically investigate the effectiveness of
social intervention programs such as education and training
(Stufflebeam and Shinkfield, 2007). At one level the demand
for an appropriately skilled workforce in an evolving global
economy has made the evaluation of adult education and

| training programs a high priority but one which seemed
relatively straightforward.

However ideological, curricular, and political rethinking
has fundamentally undermined this seeming simplicity. The
conceptual framework  underpinning theories of adult
education and training has become deeply contested. In
terms of curricular  structure the traditional focus on
behavioral outcomes has been replaced by the broader
concept of competenccs.

36

--- Page 46 ---
Equally, increased demands for value for money in
public services have resulted in   concerns about
accountability and quality moving to the fore. Evaluation has

| also progressed dramatically and is now no longer simply
concerned primarily with measurable outcomes but with
process, stakeholder roles, values, and quality. In this
seminar paper, the contextual issues to be considered in the
evaluation of adult education and training programmes are
outlined.
The Changing Face of Evaluation in Adult Education and
Training
Evaluation theory and practice in adult education and
_ training has, in recent times,  undergone © significant
development. This development reflects not only evolving
concepts of evaluation but equally dramatic changes in the
philosophy and curriculum of adult education and training.
For example, education and training in nursing and medicine
have undergone significant reform in the past 10-15 years.
37

--- Page 47 ---
Continuing with a Strong practice-based focus it now
also has an explicit focus on problem-based learning, change
management, and policy development.

The focus has also changed from one of instruction, for
example, an apprenticeship model, to a learning paradigm,
where the emphasis is on student-centered learning. The role
of the adult learner is one of active participant who sees a
relevance to learning which can be applied to practice.

The purposes and ideology of much adult education and
training have become deeply contested. Traditionally, adult
education and training had been seen as primarily concerned
with issues such as skills, labor market productivity, and
economic development. More recently, post-modernist
thinking has  moved the focus to issues of social
transformation concerned primarily with personal and
societal development as key purposes in adult education.

Particularly influential have been constructivist theories
reminding us that knowledge, while individually constructed,
requires collective and collaborative interaction as a Key        .
element of  learning. Thus,  while for certain purposes

38

--- Page 48 ---
objectives- based training in the form of skills development
may well be defensible and appropriate, the concept of adult
education and training has expanded Significantly in line
with postmodernist views of epistemology and ontology.

In the light of this changing conceptual focus, the
nature and structure of the curriculum in adult education
and training has also been reformed. In response to changes
in society, and in particular the emergence of the knowledge

economy, adult education and training is increasingly
concerned with the development of broad competences.

Competences integrate knowledge, skills, and attitudes
and are concerned primarily with developing the ability to
acquire further knowledge rather than being simply about
the possession of a particular amount of current knowledge.
In consequence, the structure  of adult education and
training programs has undergone radical change, with an
ever greater emphasis on issues of process and less concern
with the acquisition of a particular skill set.

Somewhat paradoxically, in tandem with this change in
the philosophy and curriculum structure of adult ecucation

39

--- Page 49 ---
and training  Programs, there has been also a parallel
increase in policies designed to ensure quality and value for

- money in the Provision of such programs. This is in line with
the international neoliberal movement often referred to as
new public management which has resulted in  greater
oversight of programs and initiatives in the public sector and
determination to introduce the alleged efficiencies of the free
market.

From the aforementioned discussion it should be clear
that the design and conduct of evaluation in the field of adult
education and training presents difficulties peculiar to that

| field. For example, a curriculum  based  on the complex
notions of competences requires  standards, inclicators,
criteria, and appropriate assessment procedures if it is to be
coherent. All these features must be evaluated. Since by their
nature many competences are in the expressive domain and
resistant to traditional notions of measurement, a varicty of
largely qualitative methodologies will be applied alongside
more traditional modes of testing. If, as likely in the bulk of
cases, the evaluation is concerned with both accountability
40

--- Page 50 ---
and improvement, and internal and external audiences, the
evaluation design must be able to meet all these needs.
Evaluation in the Field of Adult Education
Teaching-learning-evaluation  activity leads to the

| achievement of the educational process. All these activities
are in a relationship of interdependence. From modern
didactics perspective evaluation activity is integrated in the
educational process. The concept of evaluation has a series of
important definitions both in European and International
environment and also in Romanian pedagogy. The evaluation
is the activity through which are issued value judgments
about student's learning process and product, based on
predetermined quality criteria in order to take decisions

- according to the meaning given to the evaluation approach:
adjustment,  improvement, selection,  certification, ete.
(Manolescu, 2010).

Numerous presugious  specialists in the field of
Education Sciences have suggested various definitions of the
evaluation concept. Therefore, Hadji (1989: 21) defines the
concept of evaluation as follows: “to evaluate could mean:

41

--- Page 51 ---
check to judge, to evaluate, to lie, to represent, to cause, to
give a verdict, etc.” Another well-known definition of the
evaluation concept is the following: “In school, the evaluation
concept has the meaning of a note or a letter grade assigned
to pupil’s activity "(Abernot, 1998: 5).

Regarding adult education,  currently there are
numerous definitions of this concept, "adult education is a
social movement joining all efforts to educate adults in a
large self-conscious movement that can meet the
requirement of this century, adults more capable, more
balanced and happier’. We can talk about a series of
characteristics of adult education. Thus, in author Bhola’s
opinion (1985, and Neculau, 2004: 46) there are five major

characteristics of the concept of adult education:
1. Globality and continuity- because adult education has a
permanent character being synonymous with terms like

|       continuous education, community education.
Il, Indispensable minimum- because all people need a basic
education in order to understand the mechanisms of life.

42

--- Page 52 ---
ll Structural freedom. offers individuals the opportunity to
be educated  outside the traditional educational
institutions.

Iv. Usefulness- adult education has a functional character
and helps the individual to solve their daily problems.
v. Equity- because it addresses equally to all’.

In adult education, the evaluation is conducted by a
trainer who has some expertise in this area, representing the
main topic regarding the training and adult education. To

_ educate adults, the trainer neecls to carry on its business in

a predetermined space so that the proposed  learning
activities, leading to the attainment of the objectives set. In
higher education, student training involves a_ laborious
process of design and operation of specialized courses for
training in a specific area of interest.

Evaluation Strategies of Adults

In a large acceptation, the strategy represents “a set of
coordinating actions in order to reach a goal” (Manolescu,

~ 2010:51). We can state that in field of adult education the

evaluative strategy is a prior and advance guide ineant to
43

--- Page 53 ---
offers the Perspective from which evaluation will be designed,
having a key role with regard to issuing value judgments on
the process and results of adult training. “In the educational
evaluation, the Strategy represents the responsible conduct
evaluator demeanor in all aspects and the entire expanse of
the evaluative approach, as well as the option for the most
appropriate and more suitable type/ mode of teaching
evaluation in the given situation of educational” (Ungureanu,
2001: 148).

The strategic approach of an adult evaluation strategies
takes into account the following aspects: “establishing the
beneficiaries of the evaluation, establishing agents of the
evaluation, justification of the evaluation, establishing the
goal of the evaluation,  make the evaluation compatible
intrinsically linked with the type of training, the identification
of constraints, determining  the object of evaluation,
development of assessment tools, optimal placement in time
to start evaluating and determining its length, setting option
for the manner of interpretation of evaluation results to
establish how the valorization of the evaluation results to be

44                    |

--- Page 54 ---
materialized in post-evaluative   decisions _recovery-
breakthrough-change” (Manolescu, 2010: 52).
Evaluation Models

Designing an evaluation of adult education and training
programs involves a number of key steps. Such a structure is
important so as not to omit any vital parts of the process. In
addition the timing of evaluation is very important and this
should be decided in advance of setting up any adult
education and training programs.
°     Formative and Summative Evaluations: The timing of
evaluations has been generally differentiated into summative
evaluations (retrospective assessments of completed or
established programs) and formative evaluations (conducted
during the development of a program). Formative evaluations
are used to modify and improve a program  and this is
frequently  used to provide  feedback to staff while the
program is in operation. These evaluations assess and assist
with the formation of goals and priorities, provide direction
for planning, and guide program management. Information
from formative   evaluations 1S  directed to improving

4s

--- Page 55 ---
operations and serves  quality assurance purposes. In
contrast, summative evaluations  are used to prove
something, satisfy accountability, or make a judgment about
the overall  quality of the  program. They draw together
previously collected information, for example, from formative
evaluations. Both formative and summative evaluations are
needed in the development of a  program. In general,
formative evaluation will be dominant in the early stages of a
| program and summative will take over as the program
concludes.
e    Jacobs Evaluation Model: Jacobs outlines a ten-stage
evaluation model. The opening three stages are concerned
with collaborative and negotiated understandings around the
context and policy framework of the intervention, the goals of
the evaluation, and the identification of and consultation
with the principal stakeholders and relevant constituencies.
Stages four through seven again involve iterative negotiated
agreement on evaluation purposes and criteria, the interests
to be served by the evaluation, the aspects of the program to
be evaluated, the sources of information to be used, and the
46

--- Page 56 ---
valuation methods most appropriate. Stage eight involves the
collection of data from the agreed sources and stage nine
involves the analysis and interpretation of the data in the
context of the agreed, negotiated criteria. Stage ten involves
the dissemination of findings to the stakeholders and
constituencies identified at the beginning of the process.
Jacobs stresses that evaluators should employ this
negotiated and iterative process, regardless of where the call
and resources for the evaluation have come from. She argues
that it is central to the appropriate role of the evaluator to
_ recognize the interests and rights of all legitimate
stakeholders and to take into account power differentials
between groups.
e    Self-Evaluation: Despite the developments   ind
evaluation theory and practice outlined so far, many of these
models, including more progressive recent ones such as
Jacobs’, represent a form of evaluation which involves
judgments made through the eyes of the external evaluator
and the connotation persists of evaluation as an external
monitoring of professional practice.
47

--- Page 57 ---
The professionalization of evaluation, the dominance of
the contract and terms of reference, and the increasing use of
consultants with little knowledge of the field in which they
are trying to apply generic research methods are all likely to

- contribute to the legitimization of market-driven innovations
which deskill and disenfranchise practitioners.

Educational evaluation is not therefore an objective,
external, value-free process, but rather is deeply influential
in shaping educational philosophy and _ policy. The
conceptual and ethical stance it adopts is influencing the
educational debates to a significant degree. One particular
approach the present authors suggest is to move the focus
away from external evaluation to one focused on empowering
practitioners to self-evaluate.

In the case of adult education and training programs
the focus of judgment can move from the evaluators to the
practitioners  and the former can  find a new role in
supporting the  professional  development of the latter.
Inviting  educators to  become the key  evaluators of
educational  innovation as  opposed to  measuring the

48

--- Page 58 ---
outcomes in some external or objective way is of course
controversial.

For example, it can be argued that educators cannot be
objective evaluators as at one level it is their work and
effectiveness that is  being evaluated. On this account
evaluation must be primarily external. However, herein lies

. the dilemma not just of evaluation but also of perceptions of
teaching and learning. On the one hand, there is increasing
pressure to reduce teaching to merely implementing a proven
or tested program of instruction.

On the other hand, the literature of educational
improvement has come increasingly to emphasize that the
quality of student learning has to be seen in relation to the
quality of  teachers’ learning. This view of educators’
professional learning emphasizes that the quality of teaching

is closely bound up with the capacity of teachers to make
professional research based judgments on their own practice
and on the programs and methodologies they are being
required to implement.

49

--- Page 59 ---
.      This approach is coming to fruition in initiatives such
as peer review and peer observation of teaching, best-practice
research scholarships, action research, reflective practice,
practitioner-led research, and institution-wide development
planning. However, for this to truly happen, the values and
methodologies of self-evaluation must be inculcated into
specific education and training programs.

Summary of Literature Review

    In this literature review, various scholars expressed
their views on the concept of adult education. The researcher
made efforts to identify the characteristics of adult education
participants. It was observed that the characteristics of aclult
education participants do influence their learning and it is
common characteristics of adult education participants to
witness changes in  their lives. These changes are
physiological, psychological and sociological changes.

The  characteristics  of adult education participants

“include -_ illiteracy,  disadvantaged and undereducated
individual’s quest for new skills and knowledge. Others

50

--- Page 60 ---
include individual interests, voluntary learning, anxiety, fear,
tension, age and poverty.

|       Adult education encounters a lot of problems that
hampers it from assuming its position as an effective tool for
socio-economic   development in   Nigeria. Among these
problems are misconception of the principles and desirability
of adult education in the society, illiteracy, lack of political
will, poor budgetary provision, lack of infrastructure, lack of
instructional materials, lack of trained personnel, socio-
cultural factors and adult learners’ self-concept.

CHAPTER THREE
RESEARCH METHODS

This chapter discussed methods and the procedures
adopted in conducting the research. The discussion was done
under the following subheadings: research design, area of the
study, Population of the study, sample and sampling
techniques, method of data collection, method of data
collection, validation of instrument, and method of data
analysis.
Research Design

The research design for the study will be descriptive
survey. According to Nworgu (2006), survey  research
technique permits the description of conditions as they exist
in their natural settings. Ezeigbo (2010) defined a survey as
one in which a group of people or item are studied by
collecting and analyzing data from only a few people or items
that are considered to be representative of the entire
population. This design is suitable for this research stice
data was obtained from a representative sample of the

52

--- Page 62 ---
population. It was chosen because the research was focused
on people from whom the researcher elicited responses.
Area of Study

The area of study for this work is Nkanu West Local
Government Area. Residents of this area were used as the
study characteristics. Nkanu West Local Government Area
has its headquarters at Agbani. It has an area of 225 km?
and a population of 146695. It falls within Enugu West
senatorial district. Nkanu West Local Government Area is
made up of about nine towns which are Akpugo, Amodau,
Agbani, Amuri, Umueze, Obe, Ozalla, Obuofia and Akegbe
Ugwu.
Research Population

The research population of this study is made up of
male and female residents of Nkanu West Local Government
Area.   According to the  figure given by the  National
Population Commission of Nigeria from the census count of
2014, the population of Nkanu West Local Government Area
is 146,695. However, to get the current population of Nkanu

53

--- Page 63 ---
West Local Government Area, there will need to use the
annual population growth rate projection. According to
Nigerian Population  Worldmeters, the average annual
population growth rate of Nigeria is 2.59%. This was used to
determine the population Nkanu West Local Government
Area in 2018.
2.99% of 146695 = 3799
Annual growth is 3799. From 2006 to 2018 is a period of
twelve (12) years. 3799 x 12 = 45588.
The population of Nkanu West Local Government Area in
2018 according to the projection is 45588 + 146695 =
192283. The population of study therefore is 192283.
Research Sample
The sample of this study was derived from the rescarch
population using the Taro Yamane formula stated as
n   =      N
1 + N (e)?
Where     n     =     sample size;
         N   =   Population;                .

Sampling Technique
The sampling technique adopted by the researcher is
| the purposive sampling technique. Through this technique,
every clement in the population is given equal chance of
being selected.

The researcher adopted  this sampling — technique
because it enabled the researcher to take into account the
specific characteristics and qualities of the sample size which
represents the population under study. Also, it helped the
researcher to eliminate all sorts of bias associated with such

55

studies such as per
Personal or group interest. The elements in
the populatio
pee       " Were given equal Opportunity of being selected
based on this statistica] technique.
Instrument of Data Collection
The instrument for data collection in this study is
" questionnaire. The questionnaire is structured to contain
only closed-ended questions. The questionnaire is also
divided into two sections. The first section is designed to get
the demographic data of the respondents, while the second
section will dwell on the research questions. The
questionnaire provided for the confidentiality of the
respondents. The copies of questionnaire produced are four
hundred (400) in number, to suit the sample of the study.
Validity of the Instrument
The instrument for data collection was face validated by
three experts, two in the Department of Adult Education and
hre        ;

particular reference to the purpose of the study, research
questions and hypotheses. Their comments and observations
were incorporated into the final draft of the instrument.                        |
Reliability of Instrument

Content validity and reliability was used to determine
the validity and reliability of the instrument used in this
study. Since content validity and reliability involves experts,
the instrument was given to three experts in measurement

and evaluation, psychology as well as career and counseling.

Their judgment of the instrument formed the basis for
certifying the instrument as valid and reliable.
Administration of the Instrument

The instrument was administered face-to-face and by
hand to the respondents. This administration of instrument
was done this way to ensure that all the copies of the
questionnaire are returned. At the end of the administration,
the four hundred copies of the questionnaire were collected.

57

Method of Data Analysis
    ata in this study was analysed using tables,
frequencies and percentage for the demography of the
respondents. The responses obtained from the copies of
questionnaire administered were analysed using the formula:
A   x 100
B      1
Where A = Number of responses
B = Total number of response                   ;
.     100 = Percentage figure
1 = Constant number
Decision Rule: Any percentage score which is 50% and
above shows that the information is accepted while below
50% is rejected.                                                                       |

The hypotheses were tested using the Chi-square                            |
formula given as: -
X? = Chi-square value                                                   .

fe = Expected frequency                                   :
Decision Rule: If the calculated Chi-square value (X2) is
greater than or equal to the table value at 0.05 degree of
freedom, the alternative hypothesis is accepted, but if the
calculated value is less than the table value, the null
hypothesis (Ho) is accepted.

Discussion of Results
In
all, four hypotheses  were tested for statistical
support. In the analysis, the null hypotheses of the four
tested hypothesis were not rejected.

In hypothesis one, the focus was on whether there is
proper evaluation of adult education in Nkanu West Local
Government Area. In the analysis, the calculated Chi-square
value (0.25) was seen to be less than the table value (5.991),
validating the null hypothesis. This means that there is no
proper evaluation of adult education in Nkanu West Local

e It was the opinion of the respondents that lack of

adequate evaluation for adult education hinders      ;
educational outcome. They revealed that inadequate
evaluation on improvisation of instructional materials;

psychological foundations of adult learning and on         |
development of literacy materials to a high extent
hinder their educational outcome in their adult learning

centres.
    . The findings revealed that lack of adequate evaluation

e Adult education in Nkanu West Local Government Area
has not  contributed to sustainable  development
because adults have not been enabled to acquire
vocational skills that   would promote gainful             ;
employment, raise trainees’ general standard of living,
and make trainees self-reliant for sustainable
,      development, help trainees cope with  technological             s
changes for sustainable development and_ enable
trainees become productive and useful citizens. This is
attributed to lack of proper evaluation.                                         .
e The identified techniques for adult education evaluation
have not improved adult.                                                      |

fundamental for  obtaining  information that reflects the
extent to which an adult, having the quality of being formed
has acquired skills to help him for a social integration and a
professional approach. The Study highlights the existence of
a broad range of evaluative strategies, divided into various            .
classifications, providing multiple opportunities for trainers
to choose and combine them, depending on the contexts of            *
learning.
      Learning from and about evaluation often  requires
change in mental models - to rethink assumptions and
beliefs and to develop new  understandings about
programmes and evaluation processes. This logically should              .
lead on to an organizational learning approach to evaluation.

Recommendations
Based on the findings of this study, the following
recommendations are made:
¢ Programmes should be strengthened substantially through
effective evaluation and the basis for choices about the           |
future should be soundly established by a combination of
internal self-assessment and unbiased, informed peer
review.
e If adult education and training programs are to gain from
.  evaluation procedures and processes then the proper        .
conditions for securing these improvements must be        |
