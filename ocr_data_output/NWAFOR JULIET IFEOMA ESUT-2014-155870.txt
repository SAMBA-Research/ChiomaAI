ABSTRACT

The aim of the study was to identify the Educational needs of
Agricultural Workers in Nkanu West Local Government Area of
Enugu State. In order to achieve the purpose of this study, the
researcher formulated three research questions to guide the
investigation. Questionnaire was the main instrument used for
data collection. The data from the structured questionnaire
were arranged in tables and were worked out through the use
of mean (x) from the calculation, any mean point that is below
2.5 1s disagree while any mean (x) point from 2.5 and above is
agree. The study found that Agricultural workers lack the
knowledge of modernized farming, research, farming methods,
technology, credit, and facility, therefore, facilitators should
strive to give these farmers the necessary information on these
areas where they lack knowledge. Government,  non-
governmental organization (NGOs) or individuals should
support adult education programmes financially especially for
the disadvantaged farmers for them to become better persons
to themselves and to their community at large.

CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION
Background of the Study

The well-being and development of every socicty depends
on how educated and cultured the adults are, and for adults to
be educated and cultured, they need to actively get involved in
adult education programmes. By this, the adults become
contributive members of the society.

It is unfortunate to note that when it comes to non-literate
adults, the Agricultural Workers (farmers) are always involved.
Most of the farmers are not educated and they may not really
be contributive members of the society if they are not properly
educated.

Farmers require ongoing education to stay aware of fast-
moving developments in technology, science, business
management, and an array of other skills and fields that affect
agricultural operations.

--- Page 11 ---

Education is said to be man’s fundamental method of
reform and progress. It is regarded as a tool with which society
brings the transmission of its own culture. Education is the
industry that produces manpower for economy of nations.
Therefore, education enhances manpower development by
improving the number of quality of human resources.

Rogers (1992) and Ant (2010} defined education as all
forms of planned learning by which one person directly (face-to-
face) or indirectly (by distance methods) help another person(s)
to learn something.

Egbo (2008) defined education as the transmission of
worthwhile knowledge from the teacher to the learner(s) or from
one person to another or from one generation to another.

Afonja (2007) opined that education is truly a mirror of the
level of development and the aspiration of any pcople.
Education is general and functional literacy programmes in
particular are means of advancing people in terms of giving

--- Page 12 ---
3
them knowledge, skills, attitudes necessary for expanding their
potentials.

Akinpelu (2001) is of the view that education programmes
are organized for learners who have pre-occupation or jobs
other than studying. Furthermore, education is associated with
vocational occupation or professional skills of development.

The education needs of an Agricultural worker (adults)
vary according to their social role. Adults who newly arrive at
working age will be obsessed with learning how to make a
living. An illiterate farmer should get involved in a formal
education to enable them get a large knowledge about
agriculture.

Illiterate of an agricultural worker can be caused by lack
of awareness, illiteracy among parents, lack of family support,
social barriers, and above all poverty. For instance, for someone
born into an underprivileged milicu to parents with little formal
schooling, the likelihood of being  illiterate or experiencing
serious learning difficulties will be higher.

|   When an agricultural worker is educated, it helps him to

incorporate the latest scientific advances and technology tools
into their daily operations.

Collins English dictionary defined an Agricultural worker
as someone who works on a farm, maintaining crops such as
fruits, vegetables, grains and nuts. Some agricultural workers
only tend to livestock. They typically work under the
supervision of an agricultural manager where they receive on-
the-job training.

An agricultural worker is a person engaged in agriculture,
raising living organisms for food or raw materials. He can own a
farm land or might work as a labourer on land owned by
others. Agricultural workers face increased risk both
economically and physically if reliable, accurate information is
not available in a timely manner.

The researcher visited few farmers in Obe, Umuezeh,
Agbani and the summary report showed that 89% of Nkanu
farmers reported that risk levels has increased becausc of lack

--- Page 15 ---
5
of educated farmers. In response to this need, the Nkanu West
L.G.A, have decided to create a non-formal education
programme for those agricultural workers to enable the
development of their community to grow fast.

Research has shown that non-literate agricultural workers
are faced with lots of educational problems with their various
educational needs, therefore the conditions of these non-literate
farmers in some village in Nkanu West made the researcher to
put more interest on the educational needs of the non-literate
farmers in Nkanu West Local government Area of Enugu State.
Statement of the Problems

Every adult both literate and non-literate learners have
their educational needs but the educational needs of an
Agricultural worker needs to be handled properly by facilitators
or educators because they are seen as illiterates and have little
or no reading and writing knowledge.

Non literate farmers are faced with a lot of life challenges.
They could have difficulty in communicating with themselves

--- Page 16 ---
6
having low self-esteem and low status in the community. Non
literate Agricultural worker may not have new knowledge or
skills on how to get new information about Agricultural
products and how harmful some products maybe to their
farmland. They may not really be contributive in the society
because most of them farm for their family and for themselves
only. But education helps the Agricultural worker to know the
value of large production and to know the benefits of having
income from his farm work.

Thus, it is assumed that non-literate adults in Nkanu
West Local Government Area of Enugu State are faced with
educational problems and these problems affect most if not all
aspects of their lives.

Purpose of the Study

The main purpose of the study is to find out the
educational needs of Agricultural workers in Nkanu West Local
Government Area of Enugu State. Specifically, the study aims
to:

1. Find out the educational needs of Agricultural workers.
2. Find out how the educational needs of Agricultural workers
are motivated.
3. Find out the characteristics of Agricultural workers.
Significance of the Study

The findings of this research will be of great importance to
Agricultural workers, facilitators and the socicty at large.

The result of this study will paint a clear picture of the
educational needs of Agricultural workers and this will help the
facilitators in exposing them to literacy and when there are
more literate farmers in the society, the society tends to develop
in every aspect. This will also help the non-literate farmers
(Adults) in every area of their lives.

Scope of Study

This research work concentrated on the educational needs
of Agricultural workers in Nkanu West Local Government Arca
of Enugu State. It covered the educational needs of Agricultural

--- Page 18 ---

workers in Nkanu West L.G.A. it equally covered the
characteristics of Agricultural education, motivation of
educational needs and identification of educational needs.
Research Questions

The research questions below will guide the study.
1. What are the educational needs of Agricultural workers?
2. How are educational needs of Agricultural workers
motivated?
3. What are the characteristics of Agricultural workers?

The Concept of Education

Education is said to be s systematic process through
which an individual acquires knowledge, experience, skill and
sound attitude. It makes an individual civilized, refined,
cultured and educated. For civilized and socialized society,
education is the only means. Its goal is to make an individual
perfect. It is the key to solve various problems of life.

Education as defined by the National Policy on Education
revised (2013) is a dynamic instrument per excellence for
effecting National development and a potent means for ensuring
the welfare of the people and equalization of life chances. In the
same vein, a renowned Nigerian educational, Fafunwa (2004)
defined Education as “an aggregate of all the processes by
means of which a person develops abilities, attitudes and other
forms of behavior of positive value in the society in which he
lives.

Education can therefore be regarded as a social process
whose purpose is to bring about certain desirable behavioural

--- Page 21 ---
11
change in the total development of the individual. In the world,
education has been given more regards while in  Nigeria
particularly, education has been seen as the main vehicle for
rapid development.

UNESCO (1972) and Ani (2010), defined Education as the
“organized and sustained instruction designed to communicate
a combination of knowledge, skills and understanding valuable
for all the activities of life”.

Egbo (2008), defined education as the inculcation of
worthwhile knowledge from one generation to another or from
one person to the other. Education is said to be a deliberate
conscious effort being made to create an atmosphere of learning
and the learning process so that learners can actively develop
their potentials to have a religious, spiritual strength, self-
control, personality, intelligence, noble character and also the
skills necessary for themselves and citizens.

Philosophically, Education starts when someone is born,
starting from infancy and continues to take place during its life

--- Page 22 ---
12
time. It is right to say that the story of civilization is the story of
education. Thus, education is an integral part of human life. It
is the basic condition for development of a whole man and vital
instrument for accelerating for well-being and prosperity by the
light of Education.

The Concept of Educational Need

Educational needs are deficit in knowledge, skills, habit or
ways of behavior Muik (2004). It is the gap between “what is”
and “what should be” (Witkin, 2010). Educational need is the
gap or a discrepancy between a present state and a desired or
future state.

According to Noessel (2003), a need is neither the present
not the future state but the gap between them. If an individual
adult learner, for example has a certain level of knowledge but
requires a higher level of  knowledge in order to improve
performance, then a knowledge gap or educational need exists.
All things being equal, the individual adult learner will, in this
case, strive to close the gap by gaining additional knowledge.

--- Page 23 ---
13
However, the educational needs of individual differ from person
to person depending on the knowledge or skill one need to
acquire at a given time. For instance, an individual in a rural
village might see an obvious need for adult literacy classes,
however, another individual do not regard illiteracy as a priority
problems. For him/her, gaining agricultural  skill and
knowledge is a priority need.

Educational needs of Agricultural workers in Nkanu West
Local Government Area are need for literacy education,
Agricultural Education, Nutrition Education and _ Health
Education. It is of no use for an adult learner to be taught
learning programme which he/she does not desire or cannot
apply in resolving challenges (problems) that he/she is faced
with all walks of his career path. An adult learner knows
exactly what he/she needs and the motive behind.

The Educational Needs of Agricultural Workers

One of the major problems facing agricultural procuctivity

in Nigeria is illiteracy. This has over the years posecl great

--- Page 24 ---
14
challenges to agricultural development as well as productivity.
The level of literacy of farmers in Nigeria generally affects
agricultural practices in the country especially in rural areas.
Extension and research works are more tedious with low level
of literacy of famers. Farmers in Nkanu West L.G.A of Enugu
State usually have knowledge or experience of how to exploit
their environment yet, they require innovation information
generated  from research and development to boost their
agricultural productivity.

Apata (2010) observed that agricultural education could
enhance the productivity of farmers when they have access to
it. This could be achieved through well-equipped adult literacy
scheme designed for farmers not only to access the information
but having potency to interpret and utilize them for optimum
productivity.

Most. illiterate adult learners in Nkanu  West  Local
Government Area are farmers who have little or no knowledge
of modernized farming which breeds better productivity. This

--- Page 25 ---
15
brings about the need for them to acquire the knowledge of
modernized farming, for this knowledge to be acquired by these
non-literate adults, adult education programme should be
designed in their area to equip these farmers with agricultural
equipment and better knowledge/training for greater
productivity.

In Nigeria, farming remains generally at the subsistence
level. It is characterized by small-scale farming carried out by
peasant farmers with an average of about two hectares of land
which are usually scattered holdings (Ukeje, 2006). Though the
sector employs well over half of the nation’s labour force, it is
said to only account for about one third of gross domestic
product (GDP}. Out of 7Omillion hectares of land classified as
agricultural land in the country, only about 42million hectares
of this is currently either under permanent crop or pasture.
This leaves about 28million hectares of land for farming
(Oladapo, 2007).   Nevertheless, the agricultural  sector’s
performance has improved in recent years but it still has great
unrealized potential.

--- Page 26 ---
16
Needs of Agricultural Workers

A major problem faced by the agricultural sector is its inability
to harness the entire human capital available. Most research and
extension services are focused on crops and livestock improvements
rather than the development of farmers knowledge Olawamiwa
(2013). Development of Nigerian farmers through qualitative
educational procedures is the panacea for sustainable agricultural
development. Identifying training needs often remains. the
responsibility of outside training operators (Agahi et al, 2012). What
is good for the farmers, what is necessary and later the reason for
farmer’s lack of enthusiasm to follow the sessions organized for
them is developed (Agahi et al, 2012 and Mercoiret, 2003). Effective
training requires a clear picture of how the trainees will need to use
information after training in place of local practices what they have
adopted before in their situations. (Sajeev and Singha, 2010).

Ozowa (1995) grouped the educational needs of smallholder
farmers into five headings, agricultural inputs; extension education,
agricultural technology,  agricultural technology; agricultural
credit; and marketing.

--- Page 27 ---
17
Limited Access to Credit Facility: While the medium and
large-scale farmers, who are  mostly educated and well
connected to the government in power access soft loans from
financial institutions based on their collateral, most farmers are
illiterate peasants and cannot access these basic facilities for
the growth of their profession.

According to Odoemenem and Obinne (2010), there is very
limited access to modern improved technologies and even when
they are available, the farmers are not educated enough to
utilize them.

Modern Agricultural Inputs: Yields require a combination of
education through extension services, access to appropriate
and timely inputs as access to finance to purchase inputs
(Opara, 2011).

Research: Educational needs is essential for Agricultural
workers in the sense that educated farmer will be able to
research on a particular chemical that will be good for a
particular soil, (Ibe, 2001). An Agricultural worker should be

--- Page 28 ---
18

also to know that it will not be hazardous to the plant rather it
will help in the growth of hat crops. For instance, a farmer who
makes research for the chemical to use in the growth of maize,
millet and rice, will ensure that such chemical will not affect
the crop in any way rather it will help in their growth and be fit
for humai consumption when uprooted not chemical that will
be harmful to the body system (Ede, 2004).
Finding out different farming methods: RM Briones (2013)
explained that an educational farmer is more advanced to an
uneducated farmer because an educated farmer can be able to
differentiate the crops and know where to plant each, that is to
know each farming method to use for a particular crop but an
uneducated farmer will plant all the crops in one particular
farming method thereby preventing the growth or stunting the
growth of another crop. Ise  (1995) also said that a farmer
should always know how to plant  the crops in a different
farming method because all crops have a different ways of
growing.

--- Page 29 ---
19
Identifying different crops and time to harvest: While
farmers may grow different kinds of crops including vegetables,
beans, fibers, fruit etc. An educated farmer can be able to
identify such crops and know when best to harvest them. For
instance rice is a crop that is mostly grown in water paddies
and rice grows quite quickly and same like with oats, it must be
harvested quickly to prevent the seeds from falling off, unlike
corn kernels that are not visible because they are covered by
husk and corn are planted in rows season so you may sce them
in their different stages of growth. (IBE, 2011).
Find out the best soil for faming: When one is educated
about Agriculture, plants and soil, he or she will be able to find
out the best soil for their crop that is to identify the one that
will be beneficial to the soil, the type of soil that farmers mostly
use is loamy soil because it contains balance of all three soil
materials like silt, sand and clay plus humus because it has
higher pH and calcium levels and its previous organic matter
Job (2012).

--- Page 30 ---
20
Production of large quantity for Exportation: An educated
farmer will be able to know the crop that is most needed
following the recent resolve by the Nigerian government to give
more support to agro-allied products to enable the agricultural
workers to export their products. Therefore an agricultural
worker needs to be educated in other to get more knowledge
and skills to make his farm bigger and produce large quantity
of crops.            |
Marketing Education: Robust marketing education is
important as goods perish when they are not marketed
effectively causing more losses to the farmer. Bamiduro (2011)
observes that increase cost in transportation is the major
problem facing marketing of agricultural products in Nigeria.
Extension Education: The general lack of awareness among
smallholder farmers can be attributed their high level of
illiteracy. This contributes to eh low level of adoption of
agricultural production technology.

Motivation of Educational Need of Agricultural Workers

Adult (farmers) need to be motivated so as to attain their
various educational needs. (Ukeje, 2006) identified (the
educational needs to Nigerian farmers), the farming sector in
Nigeria is dominated by peasants who are generally uneducated
(Ukeje, 2006). They also saw that these farmers have many
educational needs to be able to perform optimally [ESUT F IBRABY

Designing educational materials to address these needs is
not always sufficient as nothing is achieved until these farmers
are able to apply the knowledge successfully to their day-to-day
farming activities. Thus they so not only  need to develop
educational materials to address these issues but also ensure
that they are made available to the farmers and they are able to
put it to good use.                                        .

This work examines at different ways they can motivate
farmers to be educated:

--- Page 32 ---
22
1. Proper planning and execution of educational
extension programmes: Every educational programme should
go through the following
e Analyse the present situation and identify needs.
e Set objectives for the extension programme
e Develop the programme to address identified need.
e Implement the programme by putting the work plan into
effect.
e Evaluate the programme and its achievements as a basis
for planning future programmes.
An efficient extension systems increases farmers zest for
more knowledge especially because they are involved at every
|  stage.
2. Method of Instruction: The mode of delivery is another
important factor. The educational materials should have audio-
visual aids and live simulations,  distributing text printed
materials, without visual itlustrations is usually unproductive

--- Page 33 ---
23
3. Qualified and friendly Educational providers: (Halima,
2014) recommends that agricultural educators should be
sponsored for seminars, conferences and _ agricultural
exhibitions at the appropriate times to better equip them on
interpersonal as well as technical skills. Having very friendly
and professional education goes a long way to motivating
farmers to seek more knowledge.
4. Educational funding and Policies: There should be more
funding for the agricultural sector. Scholarships and other
similar perks will help ensure poor farmers seek agricultural
know-how. Government should also make more policies to
encourage adult education. Aghimen, C. I. and Nosa, J. (2001).
5. Testimonials: Sharing and explaining statistics and
pictures of other successful educational programmes further
incentivize farmers to want to participate and apply the
knowledge to their farms (National Development Planning
commission, 2010).

--- Page 34 ---
24
6.   Self-Directedness (Learners Autonomy): Self cirectedness
or autonomy is what motivates some adult learners in learning
activities.

McKendry and Boyd (2012) opined that the development of
independent learning principle in Adult education programme
is of prime importance in motivating adults to learn. Hence,
adult learners should be encouraged as much as possible to be
responsible for their own learning.

Generally, those who are self-directed are perceived to be
self-determined and operate autonomously. Adult learners have
prior knowledge and vast experience and because of that, they
tend to prefer to take charge of their own learning and make
necessary connections to new learning.

The Characteristics of Agricultural Workers

According to FRANK 2016, he said that anyone can farm,
but not everyone can be a farmer. There are certain traits that
are necessary to have as a  farmer that most people don’t
possess.

--- Page 35 ---
.                                                25
These are some characteristics of a good Agricultural

worker.
(1) Patience: Farmers tend to have a lot of patience and
definitely need it in order to deal with the surprises that may
come their way with their livestock, crop equipment and
weather.
(2) The weather: Farmers watch the weather every day to
make sure their crop and livestock aren’t dramatically affected.
Their ability to monitor weather conditions allows them to
understand what they need to do when it comes to growing,
harvesting, and selling their crop as well as producing feed for
their livestock.
(3) Hard work: As a farmer, some years and seasons are
worse than others and require more work. But farmers keep on
going and work through the tough times in order to produce
product for their communities.
(4) The Environment: Farmers know better than anyone that
preserving the environment is important. They constantly
continue to make improvements to their land and_ the

--- Page 36 ---
26
environment so that they can have better crop seasons in the
future.

In all this characteristics of an Agricultural worker, the
farmers can also get more knowledge on how to manage his
farm, if he is educated (Fouch, 2007). Education is said to be
one of the factors that affect agricultural productivity. After the
study in Nkanu West L.G.A, (Svinicki, 2004), it was unraveled
that education indeed has an effect on agricultural productivity,
but this effect has been minimized due to low educational level
of farmers in Nkanu West as well as level of provision of
extension services. Also, the farmers faced other factors that
magnify the effects of education such as transportation,
resources availability and cost of farm equipment and input
which minimized the effect of education on agricultural
productivity of farmers {Edeh, 2017).

The literacy level  of farmers in Nkanu West Local
Government Area is very low even with 37% of farmers having
obtained basic education which necessitates the improvement

--- Page 37 ---
27         |
of the educational level of farmers in Nkanu reap the benefits
that education has an agricultural productivity. The channel
through which this can be done is through adult literacy
classes. It was found out during the study that only two
communities in Nkanu have access to adult literacy classes.
Adult literacy classes is a great channel that can be exploited
because enhanced literacy gives farmers confidence in decision
making and enables them read instructions (Ani, 2010). The
non-formal section of the educational directorate can train
basic school teachers and other literates in the communities to
hold the classes and teach the illiterates so that more farmers
will learn basic literacy and numeracy to enhance their
agricultural activities.

Relationship between Agricultural Education and Research
and Extension

With few exceptions,  the institutional relationships
between agricultural teaching and research and extension
services are inadequate. In many countries, this is the result of

--- Page 38 ---
28

|

the deliberate Separation of education, research and extension

.                                                    |

into different ministries and agencies and a lack of functional          |
mechanisms to link them together to solve common problems.
Agricultural research is usually conducted at government
research stations and laboratories, the majority of which are
not linked with universities. Research activities are often
carried out as part of postgraduate programmes of higher
agricultural education, but they are seldom directly related to
national research priorities and programmes. There are some
significant exceptions to this separation of education and

research.

In India, for example, agricultural universities carry out
an important part of research activities and are integrated
within the programmes of the Indian Council for Agricultural
Research (ICAR). Some specialised centres of ICAR (called
University Centres), in turn, offer postgraduate M.Sc. or Ph.D.
training programmes.  Another example is the Colegio de
Postgraduados in Mexico, which was created specifically to
balance research,  postgraduate  teaching and extension

--- Page 39 ---
29           !
activities (Bawden, 1996). The participation of higher education
institutions in research activities needs to be planned as part of             :
the regular activities of the teaching staff and their students.         |
The credibility of these activities, and the possibility of          |
obtaining the necessary research resources, depends on the
activities being relevant to farmers and to national research
priorities.

For agricultural education institutions to participate more
fully in research, the role of research should be clearly defined
in the institutional policies and in the responsibilities of faculty
members. As with research, close working relationships
between agricultural education institutions and extension
systems are indispensable in order to ensure the relevance and
contribution of agricultural education (Crowder, 1998).

As with research, however, the involvement of agricultural
education institutions in extension and community outreach is
often limited. Even in those countries where extension and
agricultural education are  not separated into different
ministries, the lack  of resources and linking mechanisms

--- Page 40 ---
30
greatly limits joint activities. Notable exceptions are those
institutions which have been organized with outreach or      :
extension responsibilities and are provided with the necessary          !
means to carry them out.                                                        |
Universities provide training and technical support to      |
extension subject-matter specialists and have direct contacts
with significant numbers of farmers. The universities often
maintain their own units of extension and communication for
this purpose. In the case of Mexico, the Colegio de
Postgraduados has established a Centre for Development
Studies with four regional units, one in each ecological zone of
the country. These units provide a link between academic
programmes, extension activities, and rural producers. One
way for universities and technical institutes to implement
development outreach activities is by follow-up technical
support to graduates working in agri-businesses or managing
their own production enterprises.
Also, short courses of continuing education can be
designed to update extension officers’ knowledge and to qualify

--- Page 41 ---
31

extension staff for career advancement. Continuing education
should, wherever possible, make use of farmers’ associations,         |
graduate associations, NGOs, commercial enterprises and     :
research and _ extension centres.  Agricultural education        |
institutions, working with appropriate government agencies and             ;
non — governmental organizations (NGOs), need to develop       |
research and demonstration plots that directly address farmers’
needs. This requires that farmers be valued for their
contribution to production through their innovations and
sharing of local knowledge. For their part, farmers’
organizations need to do a better job of communicating the
needs of their members to agricultural education institutions.
Farmer advisory boards are one way to improve communication
between agricultural education  institutions and local
producers.
Environmental Issues in Agricultural Education

In many parts of the world, the increasing needs of
growing populations for food, fuel and fibers have led to
deforestation, severe soil erosion, loss of water resources, and

--- Page 42 ---
32
eventually declining crop production. It is clear that the loss of
natural resources and environmental degradation affects food
security. It is also clear that institutions of education in
agriculture need to incorporate environmental and sustainable
agricultural development issues into their curricula.                             |
Environmental and sustainable agricultural development         |
problems require an inter-disciplinary approach to curricula        |
since sustainable development relates not only to technological
concerns, but also to economic. social, cultural, ecological, and
public policy matters (Karl, 1997). Furthermore, curricula need
to provide students with opportunities to observe first: hand the
physical, technological and social aspects of natural resource
uses for agriculture through  learning activities that are
experiential and problem focused.
Experience  shows that institutions of  agricultural
education can play a vital role in bringing about changes in
peoples’  attitudes and  practices so  that they are more
environmentally  responsible.  Developed countries have  for

--- Page 43 ---
33
some time included environmental concerns in their teaching         |
curricula, research activities and outreach  programmes.       |
Current practice in agricultural education in many developing
countries, however, does not demonstrate widespread
integration of environmental and sustainable agriculture topics
into academic programmes. Rather, these topics are added       ;
piecemeal to existing curricula, if at all.                                          :
|
Three main issues can be identified which affect the       |
challenge of integrating environmental and_ sustainable
development themes or issues into agricultural education
programmes. Brief description of these issues is presented
below:
e First, such issues are complex and diverse. They involve
social, cultural, political and economic aspects as well as
technical   and   scientific   information.   Thus,   an
interdisciplinary approach is essential.
© Second, agricultural education institutions are not always
structured to deal with the complexity of these issues.

--- Page 44 ---
34
Substantial institutional reorientation and attitude change        ;
among faculty members may be necessary. In order to       |
achieve such changes, the training and redeployment of
teachers may be needed along with greater involvement of
students, younger, environmentally-aware staff and rural
communities in the design of new curricula.                                  !
e Third, new approaches to learning and knowing which      |
incorporate the environmental knowledge of local people are           |
needed. These new approaches should involve people
(students, teachers, producers)  learning together in
collaborative, knowledge-sharing situations on campus and
in the field. The ultimate aim should be to make
environmental issues inseparable from the professionalism of
graduates, the  production practices  of farmers, the
commercial objectives of agri-businesses and the interests of
society for a safe and secure environment.

35         .
Integrating Population Issues into Agricultural Education

Today, there is a greater need in the developing countries
to teach agricultural students population issues in relation to          :
development problems. Institutions of agricultural education
need to incorporate population education concepts and
principles into curricula since many agricultural graduates will            ;
become managers, planners, and policy-makers who need to        |
understand the dynamic inter-relationships between food,      |
population, the environment and socio-economic development.          |
Furthermore, students trained to work as extension agents
need to be able to engage farm families in dialogue about
sensitive population issues and to effectively communicate
population messages to rural people.

Population  education should develop awareness and
understanding of the nature, causes and implications of
population  growth and  distribution as they relate to
agricultural productivity and rural development, and how these
issues affect, and are affected by, farmers, their families and
society as a whole. Population education can be integrated into

--- Page 46 ---
36
training institutes by creating a separate population education
course required of all students; by introducing population
education as modules into existing courses; and by integrating           ;
population education issues and content into relevant topics in
courses of study within existing curricula.

An FAO project in Malawi has taken the route of
integrating population issues into existing courses of study at          |
the Natural Resources College and the National Forestry           !
College. The country has one of the highest annual population
growth rates in Africa and its population density is one of the
highest on the continent. The project was a response to
escalating concerns about the relationships between  rapid
population growth, food security,  land use, environmental
stress and poverty in Malawi. The basic strategy of the project
was to enable extension agents to include  population
education, as it relates to agriculture and forestry, in their work
with farm families. To implement this strategy, the project had
two training components: pre-service training for students and
in-service training for agents in the field.

--- Page 47 ---
37
Population issues are a good example of how to integrate           .
the teaching of values and attitudes into an agricultural subject
area. Educators need to develop teaching strategies that         |
emphasize and help students develop their affective reasoning
skills. Since the attitudes and values that people possess are
difficult to change, educators need to place greater emphasis on             |
the psychology of the change process, thus improving the       |
likelihood that change in practice will come as a result of
educational efforts.                                                                   |
Gender Issues in Agricultural Education
|
Women play a major role in the world's agricultural
production systems. In the less  developed countries, an
estimated one-third of all rural households are managed by
women. In Sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, women
produce 60-80 percent of basic foodstuffs, while in Asia they
perform over 50 percent of the labor involved in intensive rice
cultivation. In recent years,  there has been widespread
recognition of the vital roles played by women in all areas of
agriculture and the need for women to have access, through

--- Page 48 ---
38
formal and non-formal training, to the knowledge and skills        |
needed for improved agricultural production, processing and
marketing.
Extension agents, researchers, teachers and students all         |
need to be educated and informed about rural women's
problems, potentials and aspirations. The 1991 FAO expert
consultation urged that special efforts be made to recruit and          |
support female students from rural areas who could become         |
extension agents, agricultural researchers, teachers and policy-            !
makers. One of the reasons why there are few women extension             |
workers, researchers and other agricultural professionals is the            |
small number of female graduates from intermediate and
higher level agricultural education institutions. Yet, there are
various countries where the enrollments of women are
proportionately high. On average in Africa, FAO data show that
there has been a 10 percent increase from 1983 to 1993 from
about 15 to 25 percent female enrollment in agricultural
education institutions.

--- Page 49 ---
39
The question of how to attract more female students to         |
agricultural disciplines is linked to the issue of encouraging        |
students from rural areas to enter higher education. As noted           :
above, the number of female students has increased over the          |
past ten years and this trend should be supported and      |
encouraged. Also, more role models for young women to      3
emulate are needed, including teachers in agricultural        |
education institutions. Raising the number of women in      |
agricultural education, both as educators, administrators and          i
students is important as a means of reinforcing a commitment            |
to understanding and changing the status of women in
agriculture.
Educators need to become more responsive to gender
related issues by taking into account women's roles and
contributions in the total agricultural industry. While there is a
trend for increased enrollment  of women students in
agricultural sciences at the technical or higher levels, this has
not resulted in the dissemination of improved technology to
women farmers because few female graduates are cmployed in

--- Page 50 ---
40          ,
extension work.  Agricultural  education institutions  may
increasingly have gender sensitive admittance policies, but due            :
to traditional barriers female  graduates continue to have          |
problems finding  employment in agriculture. Strategies,          |
curricula, and policy shifts need to emphasize and include       ,
women as role models and leaders in agriculture.                              |

Gender-sensitive policies have, at best, resulted in training             |
programmes in which women are treated equally with men.        |
However, it is not only the equal treatment of women that is
important; it is equal employment benefits that are important.           |
Equal treatment does not necessarily lead to equal benefits for
women; indeed, the treatment may have to be different in order
to take into consideration the different needs, time constraints
and productive activities of women (Rogers, 1996).

Gender-sensitive educational polices should be developed
with a wide-range of  stakeholders, including community
leaders, politicians, potential employers and especially women
themselves. Measures should be put in place to encourage
young women and better prepare them to take up agricultural

--- Page 51 ---
a1

studies. For example, Special attention should be paid to      -
revising admissions policies that discriminate against women
and to the creation of special scholarships for women to study           |
agriculture. There is also a need to provide gender sensitisation
courses for teaching staff and to eliminate stereotyping of
females in agricultural studies. In some cases, professional
organizations of women agriculturalists can act as pressure        .
groups for these changes.                                                          |
An Inter-Disciplinary Systems Approach to Agricultural      :
Education                                               |

At a relatively early stage of their education, students need             :
an overview of the agricultural and rural systems of their
countries. Throughout their training, they need not only      !
specialized courses which deal in-depth with specific technical          |
subject-matter, but courses that help them think holistically, or
in terms of integrated agricultural systems, so that they can
understand the  multi-dimensional nature of  sustainable
agricultural production. This requires an inter-disciplinary
systems approach to agricultural education.

--- Page 52 ---
42
Training in the  Systems approach is essential for
agricultural education because of the increasing complexity of
agriculture, food and rural  systems, the problems of
environmental protection and management, women farmers       )
and household issues and the needs of small-scale farmers.
Even conventional subject-matter teaching should take place
within an inter-disciplinary framework of agricultural systems         |
rather than as isolated subjects. Increasingly, education in
agriculture needs to take the form of courses in agro-forestry,
agroecology, and the socio-economics of integrated production         |
|
systems. Local food production systems need to be studied in         |
terms of the complexities of the Jarger economic and social
context. A systems approach to agricultural education makes it           |
possible to understand,  evaluate and integrate the many         :
disparate elements of production systems into a unified study          |
of how those systems work and how they affect the biological,          :
economic and social environments.
Teaching an  inter-disciplinary, systems approach to
agricultural and rural development applies to training students

--- Page 53 ---
43
at every level of agricultural] education (secondary, intermediate
and higher levels). A systems  approach to agricultural
education requires a team-teaching methodology using case        |
studies, problem-solving approaches and practical, field-based
exercises. The goals of education in agricultural systems can be
achieved through approaches that:                                                .
e Focus on whole-farm systems rather than single
disciplines;
e Incorporate methods (e.g., participatory rural appraisal) to           !
assess   socio-economic impacts on _ agricultural        |
productivity;
e Use agro-ecological systems as the unit of study and       |
analysis;                                          :
e Encourage  multi-disciplinary teams  in teaching and        |
encourage students to work in problem-solving groups,        :
and                                              |
e Emphasize  the linkages between  basic and applied
science, between research, education and extension, and

--- Page 54 ---
44
between people, the environment, sustainable agricultural
g
production and rural] development.

Students need to be provided with more active learning roles

within a farming  systems perspective. Curricula need to

integrate course work so that students can apply a range of

skills to solving agricultural problems. To be effective
agricultural change agents, students need to learn how to       .
effectively communicate with farmers. Finally, more of their
education needs to be experientially based.
Impact of Lack of Agricultural Education, Information and          ;

knowledge-losses that result from the death or migration of        |

rural farmers; the icss productive teaching methods applied by

agricultural teachers and extension workers; the effects of these

methods on the graduates of agriculture and the productivity of

--- Page 55 ---
45

framers; and at the core of these, the inactive role of
institutions providing higher education in agriculture.

According to McCalla in Acker (1999), knowledge is an         |
increasing important driver in expanding food production. For
Acker (1999), agricultural knowledge systems play a central
role in developing and disseminating knowledge, information,
and technologies relevant to food security and environmental
sustainability.

However, because of the difficulties and challenges posed
to food security due to the inability of these systems to
adequately play their roles, Acker (1999) argued that current
systems of higher education in agriculture are in need of
fundamental reform to support improvements in global food
security and environmental sustainability. Until the reforms are
carried out, the status quo in most agricultural educational        |
institutions, poor  management of  information and of
communication, remain part of the challenges to the realization           |
of food security.

--- Page 56 ---
46
Leaning on the views of FAO (1997) already cited above,
Acker (1999) presented some issues as constraints (with
inherent opportunities) against productive agriculture and food
security. The issues presented were: lack of global cooperation;
educational nationalism; sources of knowledge; globalization of           |
educational content; gender imbalances; narrow disciplinary
approach; and narrow definition of scholarship. Acker (1999)
argued that the current landscape of cooperation among      |
entities engaged in higher education in agriculture is a
“patchwork” rather than a network. This patchwork is
inadequate in supporting the required cooperation on a global,
multi-regional basis inclusive of both developing and developed           |
countries in combating food crisis. With the development of
communication technology, a truly globa] association — that
enables curriculum sharing and cross-fertilization of thoughts —
may now be feasible (Acker, 1999: 49).
With regard to “Educational nationalism”, Acker (1999)
argued that provincial or nationalistic views constitute a
significant constraint and challenge to the improvement of

--- Page 57 ---
a7
systems of higher education in agriculture and the achievement
of food security. According to him, too frequently, there is a
tendency to believe that “our approach is best” (1999:49).

Giving attention to the problem relating to sources of

agricultural knowledge, Acker (1999) held that there is an
under-recognised source of knowledge of agriculture within
society. According to him, agricultural education and indeed
most extension workers, rely on research-based information
generated by scientists to fill their lectures, text books, and
extension bulletins. But, there is the need to surmount the
challenges posed by this form of accessing knowledge and
information about agriculture by considering a different
paradigm related to sources of knowledge. This source of
knowledge he referred to as indigenous knowledge. And in his
view, this source  of knowledge is crucial to  informing
agricultural education professionals about the accumulated
wisdom of individuals  and families involved directly in
cultivating the soil and in animal husbandry (Acker, 1999:49-
50). This brings to mind the views of FAO (1997) in which it

--- Page 58 ---
48
argued that the most important source of knowledge relevant to
development in agriculture and the realization of food security
are the rural people themselves. Their systems of life and of
production embody this knowledge. As such, the description          |
and analysis of these systems should be necessary point of
research, training, extension and other actions intended to help
in realizing more food secure societies.

However, another challenge lingers. It is the problem of
knowledge-losses that results from the death or migration of
rural individuals most of whom are involved directly in farming.
It is also related to the poor techniques of preservation,
management, and  communication of information in rural
societies. The challenges that these constitute become more
evident when these “most important sources of knowledge
relevant to development in agriculture” migrate to do non-
agricultural works (FAO, 1997); or when the intergenerational
knowledge transfer is fractured as a result of the premature
illness and death ofa houschold labour power due to HIV/AIDS
(Gillespie and Kadiyala, 2005:20}-

Future Investment in Agricultural Education and Training
(AET)

Agricultural education and training for agricultural
workers can be improved for better productivity. The following
measures can be adopted in doing this:                                            |
Targeting specific institutions and audiences: In the light of
diminishing aid resources, investment in AET ought to be
concentrated in relatively few, carefully targeted institutions, in
order to ensure’ sufficient impact both to enhance
sustainability, and to provide a critical mass of staff and other
stakeholders able to disseminate innovation more widely.
Prerequisites include a  moderately supportive _ policy
environment and receptive leadership in the institution. In
some cases link programmes may still be the most effective
means of supporting development, but should be of sufficient
length and   continuity to allow change to  become
institutionalised and to be adequately supported (Gebeda,
Nhlapo, Van Niekerk, Taylor and Underwood, 1996)

--- Page 60 ---
50
_ A particular form of institutional support is the design of
split-site PhD and MPhil programmes, as well as joint research
and publication that can  help to build up professionals’
capacities within the region. These need to be accompanied by
institutional capacity building, so that newly trained staff can            |
operate in a supportive and affirming environment.                                |
One important target audience for AET is considered to be
the senior policy makers in the sector, who are often overlooked
in spite of their crucial influence. This is equally valid for the
managers of training institutions and of other organisations,
such as accreditation bodies. In many cases the most effective
training for managers will be short courses, workshops and
study visits having a management of change’ focus, which may
be most beneficial, as well as cost-effective, if offered within the
region or even home country.
The purpose of much investment in AET is ultimately to
achieve better  service dclivery to  rural people. In many
instances this will be achieved second- or third-hand, through
the training provided for extension staff, or through indirect

support for the capacity building of NGOs and CBOs. Wherever
possible, donors should seek to promote learning models which
lead to interaction between institutions and rural communities
and where participatory approaches are both taught and
practised. In order to achieve these ends projects need to be of
a process nature, with inbuilt flexibility and longtime scales.
Creating excellence: Undoubtedly strategic decisions should
be taken on the basis that potential for achieving sustainable
excellence does exist at the outset of any project, and can be
achieved through replication or adaptation of  models of
SUCCESS.

The development of linked (e.g. split-site) degree programmes or
collaborative research can help promote excellence, provided
that they are accompanied by institutional development and
that supportive leadership is in place (Mrema and Woodend,
1995)

Another  possibility  is to change the role  of training
institutions’ libraries into learning resource centres’, as part of

--- Page 62 ---
52
a programme of institutional development. This would need
intensive training for librarians to become   ‘learning
consultants’ with a proactive role.
New approaches in teaching and learning: New approaches in
teaching and learning are an area of great potential. The
adoption of new learning paradigms (interactive learning, the          |
incorporation of ITK, the use of participatory methodologies)
has proven successful in the implementation of several recent
AET projects. Future investments in AET could usefully be
directed towards the creation of ‘learning organisations which
adopt these paradigms.

Various forms of educational delivery can be very effective.
Distance learning has the advantage of keeping the trainee in
the work environment, as does part-time learning. IT can play a
significant role in the  development of future  educational
delivery as the expansion of electronic access is spreading
rapidly over the world. Already UK institutions, including the
Wye external programme, are beginning to offer courses via the

--- Page 63 ---
53
World-Wide Web. Donor Support in this sector might yield great
benelits, provided that a proper framework for an integrated
learning system has been put in place (Wallace, Mantzou and
Taylor, 1996).
Linking AET with the formal education sector: Linking pre-
service and in-service AET to the school system is an area that              |
has been largely ignored. Communication between agricultural
teachers and extensionists can provide a base for interchange
of ideas and should be encouraged, as should links between
rural schools and local communities. The latter was attempted
quite widely in the 1970s and 1980s with limited success, but
development of outreach programmes from training institutions
could be strengthened by the  creation of networks where
schools, local NGOs and community-based organisations are
involved as intermediaries.
Dissemination and replication: Recent projects have shown
the possibilities  of “cascading  AET innovation from pilot
schemes to wider application. Dissemination and replication

--- Page 64 ---
54
can be enhanced through workshops or the   blicati
publication of
successful project reports (Wallace and Nilsson, 1997). Donors
can usefully support regional workshops which enable AET
planners and practitioners from different countries to share
experiences and research findings.

Design of the Study
This study adopted a survey research design. Ogbazo and
Okpala (2004) opined that survey research is one in which a
group of people is studied by collecting and analyzing data from
people considered to be representatives of the entire group.
Ogbazo and Okpala (2004) also noted that survey uses

Area of the Study

This study was  carried out in Nkanu West Local
Government Area of Enugu State. Nkanu West is one of the
local governments in Enugu. Nkanu West is a local government
area in Enugu State with administrative headquarters in the
town of Agbani. Nkanu West Local Government Area falls
within the eastern senatorial zone of Enugu State otherwise
known as Enugu East Senatorial District alongside Enugu
North, Enugu South, Enugu East, Isi Uzo and Nkanu East
Local Government Areas. Nkanu West Local Government area
also forms a federal constituency alongside Nkanu East Local
Government Area.

Nkanu West Local Government Area covers an arca of
255km2. The local government area is bounded to the north by
Enugu South Local government area, to the east and south by
Nkanu East Local government area, and to the west by Awgu
and Oji  Local  Government Areas.  Nkanu West Local
Government Area is made up of six (6) rural communities

Population of the Study
The population for the  study consisted of all the
facilitators currently serving in the four (4) literacy centers in
Nkanu West Local Government Area of Enugu State. The target
population of this study is twenty four (24) facilitators. Each of
the four literacy centers is made up of 6 facilitators.
Sample and Sampling Technique
The researcher did not sample the population of the study,
due to small population size. Therefore, the researcher studied
all the 24 adult education facilitators in the literacy centers in
Nkanu West Local Government Area of Enugu State.

Summary of Findings

In the final  analyses, the data  collected by the
questionnaire which guided the  study revealed that the
educational needs of Agricultural workers are research, finding
out different farming methods, identifying different crops and
time to harvest, and production of large quantity for

The study also revealed the various methods of motivating
the agricultural workers to be educated which are; proper
planning and execution of educational extension programmes,

CHAPTER FIVE                         .
DISCUSSION OF FINDINGS, EDUCATIONAL IMPLICATION,
RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSION
This chapter deals with the  following sub-headings:

Recommendations and Suggestions for further  Studies,
Limitation and Summary.
Discussion of the Result                                       |
From the result of the finding in table 1, it is evident that
the agricultural workers need to get different research, find out
different farming methods, identify different crops and time to
harvest, and production of large quantity for exportation. Most
non-literate farmers due to their level of illiteracy have little or
n-lit

68
have little or no  knowledge of reading and writing, they
therefore, need to be educated more on agricultural activities.

Non-literate farmers need to get different research in other
to know the particular chemical that will be  good for a
particular soil, a chemical that will not be hazardous to the
plant rather it will help in the growth of that crop. Non-literate
farmers need to find out different farming methods in other to
help him know the particular method of each crop. A farmer
should be able to know how to plant the plant crops in different
farming methods because all crops have a different way of
growing. Non-literate farmer’s needs to identify different crops
and time to harvest, hence the seeds may start falling off. Non
literate farmer also needs to grow his product in large quantity
for exportation so he can also benefit from it.

From the result in table 2, which sought out the various
methods of motivating the agricultural workers, the researcher
discovered that all the respondents rated positive towards the
methods of  motivating   the agricultural workers. The

--- Page 79 ---
69
educational needs of  agricultural workers are  motivated
through this method,  proper planning and execution of
educational extension programmes, this means to evaluate the
programme and its achievements as a basis for planning future
programmes, and_ self-directedness (learner’s  autonomy).
Mckendry and Boyd (2012) explained that the development of
independent learning principle in Adult education programme
is of prime importance in motivating adults to learn.

Educational needs can also be motivated through
interactive learning environment because when learners are
given the opportunity to express their views and equally ask
questions, they tend to be more interested in learning. Qualified
and friendly educational providers also helps in motivating
agricultural  workers (Halima,  2014) recommends _ that
agricultural  education  should be sponsored for  seminars,
conferences and agricultural exhibitions at the appropriate
times to better equip them on interpersonal as well as technical
skills.

--- Page 80 ---
70
Finall
y, from the result of the findings of table 4, there is
indication that three respondents are in positive side and one in
negative side. The result indicates the  ways in which
agricultural workers can be characterized. Agricultural workers
are patience, risk takers, hard work and weather observers.
Educational Implication
The purpose of educational research is to design channels
of solving educational needs. It is not all about gathering,
presenting and analyzing data not just answering the research
questions posed. An important aspect of research is to locate
the educational implication of findings and make
recommendations.
Findings of this  study have a lot of educational

71
workers, they may end up remaining ignorant of the benefits of
modernized farming, while they are being enrolled in such
programmes, they will gain more agricultural knowledge which
would guide them to enhance their productivity and improve
their standard of living.

' Therefore, facilitators, government or non-governmental
organization (NGOs) should help organize and = support
educational programme where they should acquire such
knowledge.

It is also indicated that agricultural workers  need
education. The major implication of this is that agricultural
workers if not given agricultural education may not be useful to
themselves and to the society where they belong, they may also
be prey to poverty and crime because there farm may not fetch
income for them.

It is also discovered that the agricultural workers need
research education.  The major implication  of this is  that
agricultural workers if not given research education, they may

n              right chemical to use on their soil, and that may
prevent the crop from growing which is a problematic issue.

It is also discovered that  agricultural workers need
agricultural education to help them know the profit one can
make in agricultural product and the benefit of exportation. But
uneducated agricultural workers do not have the knowledge of
making profit from his farm.

Recommendations

Based on the findings and implications highlighted in this

study, the researcher made the following recommendations:
1. Government, non-government  organization (NGOs) | or
individuals, should set up oF  organize educational

2. Facilitators should try as much as possible to make learning

easy for these agricultural workers. They should be handled

properly, should be given the opportunity to take more
control over learning. Facilitators should educate them on
what is relevant to them and also should allow them to share
their experiences while learning.

3. Facilitators should endeavor to give these agricultural
workers the necessary information and knowledge they need
in order to attain their various educational needs.

Conclusion

From the result of the study, the researcher made the
following conclusion. In view of the fact that agricultural
workers have several educational needs, it is concluded that
government,   non-government  organization (NGOs) and
individuals should  support educational programmes either
financially or  otherwise for  these agricultural workers to
achieve their educational need.

--- Page 84 ---
74
It is also concluded that adult education or agricultural
education services are better rendered by experts of adult
education (facilitators), so, facilitators in the four literacy
centers in Nkanu West Local Government Area of Enugu State
should help to educate these farmers about Agricultural
Education so as to enable them become better persons for
themselves and their society.
Suggestions for Further Studies                                  |
From the findings and recommendations of the study,
further studies are perceived to be needed in these areas:
1. This study should further be conducted in the literacy
centers in all the local government areas i Enugu State.
2. Emphasis should be made on the importance of adult and
continuing education programmes to farmers.
3. Problems associated with literacy among the farmers in
Nkanu West Local Government Area.                           .

Limitations

The re         ‘

Searcher of this work was faced with a lot of
limitation and impediments during the period of carrying out
this research project, some of which are;

1. Financial problem
2. Conflicting time schedule
3. Problem of reaching the respondents

The issue of finance is one of the major problems
encountered by the researcher after the rigorous process in
carrying out the research. The researcher was challenged. by
